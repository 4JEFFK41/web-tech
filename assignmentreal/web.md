Background:

Due to the pandemic happening right now I feel it's much harder to be able to rent a student property due to various reasons such as the 
uncertainty of university right now and landlords might not be too keen or happy on taking university students on as there might be issues
with students being able to afford the rent because of lack of jobs and also possible problems with student finance. 

Also this business would organise utility bills and other bills such as WiFi and make it much easier for the student to pay a one off cost
instead of paying multiple times on different dates would take stress off the student as if you've just come from school it could be a shock
which down the line could lead to debt if the student doesn't pay or forgets to pay certain bills.

Although estate agents are the middle men for landlords I feel there should be extra help if the estate agents take too long or just don't
fix certain problems within the property and with this business it would mean constantly be in contact with the estate agents making sure
problems get solved.

Colour/Accessibility:

The design is very simple and straight to the point as with the colours it's just bright blue for the heading and a grey background for the
main body which I feel goes well together.

GDPR: 

As personal information such as name and contact numbers will be needed for this website to function I have created the privacy policy

Distance Selling:

As this is an online service we would need to adhere to the 'Online and distance selling act' and we would need to provide the information:
- Business Name
- Description of service
- Full price
- Payment options
- Contract length
- Conditions for ending contract
- How they can cancel the contract

Conclusion:

I feel the website itself is fit for purpose but could of been worked on more to make it look more presentable especially on the 'About us' page
and also the 'Homepage' but for what the website intended use is I feel it's adequate. I had alot of problems with the slideshow on the news section
as I found it hard to fully fit it on the website as I had issues with the padding but after trial and error it solved the problem. Also I tried
implementing 'Javascript form validation' with the apply section of the website but encountered many problems. Lastly there is a problem with the
homepage on certain browsers as it seems the elements move whenever I hover on the navigation bar.
